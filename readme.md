## The Project

Spaced is a simple JavaScipt game I developed during my time studying General Assembly Sydney's WDI course. I built the game primarily to explore the process and techniques of creating games and animations in JS. Because of this, I decided against using any game development frameworks - the game is based purely in HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery. It's a work in progress, with many improvements still to be made!
